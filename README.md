# digital_clock
Designing digital clock with HTML,CSS and Javascript 
highlighting importance of date and time concepts one of the key to the basics of Javascript 
## Note:
There is catch in getMonth() function as it returns **0 for January** ,**1 for February** and so on till **11 for December** so increment by **1** to display month number accurately while displaying clock.
## Thank you!!!
Looking forward to contribute more
